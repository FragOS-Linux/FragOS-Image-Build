Welcome to FragOS - Your Immutable Arch-Based Operating System!

==============================
🔐 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
==============================
FragOS ia an immutable Linux system based on Arch Linux. It uses Btrfs snapshots, GitHub-based image updates, and provides a reliable, minimal, and atomic environment.

All system files are **read-only** and managed via prebuilt images. Your personal data is stored separately and never overwritten.

==============================
📦 SYSTEM STRUCTURE
==============================
- Root filesystem (`/`) is **read-only**
- `/zenkai_root` — your persistent data (user config, home, etc.)
- `/zenkai_root/deployments` — contains deployed FragOS system images

==============================
⚙️ PACKAGE MANAGEMENT
==============================
⚠️ **Pacman is disabled in FragOS.**
You cannot install, update or remove packages using `pacman`!

✅ Use **Flatpak** to install and manage applications:
Example:
```bash
flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.firefox
flatpak run org.mozilla.firefox

✅ You can also install and update applications using the Discover software center (included by default), which integrates Flatpak.

==============================
⚙️ BASIC USAGE
==============================
System updates are performed using the zenkai-deploy tools, but your system be automatically updated

==============================
🆘 SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING
==============================
Logs: View system logs using journalctl or check /var/log.

Boot issues: You can roll back to a previous image if needed.

==============================
📄 NOTES
==============================

Do not delete or modify /zenkai_root unless you know what you're doing.

Only Flatpak is supported for installing applications.

To fully reset your system, you can wipe /zenkai_root and repair using the Zenkai installer.

FragOS is built to be secure, reproducible, and minimal for gaming — changes are made through controlled system image updates only.

Thank you for using FragOS!
